# **File Compression Project**

This project provides a simple Java GUI application for compressing text files using two different algorithms: Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman Coding.


## **Features**
•	Compress text files using Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman Coding algorithms.
•	Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy file selection and compression.
•	Displays compression status and saves compressed files in the same directory as the original file.


## **How to Use**
1.	Select File: Click the "Select File" button to choose a text file for compression.
2.	Compression: The application will compress the selected file using both RLE and Huffman Coding algorithms.
3.	Result: Compressed files will be saved in the same directory as the original file with appropriate file extensions (rle_compressed.txt and huffman_compressed.txt).
4.	Status: The GUI displays the compression status and the paths where the compressed files are saved.


## **Dependencies**
This project requires Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
